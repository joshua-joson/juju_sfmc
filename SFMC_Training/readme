This repository demonstrates a use case scenario where SFMC is used to calculate student's grades from an import file. The grading system is as follows

50% Quizzes
20% Other Learning Activities
30% Final Exam

Passing percentage of the subject is 70%. To see the grade equivalent and the realtime computation of student's grades, kindly check Grade Sheet.xlsx

Tools used in creating the needful in SFMC:
1. Email Studio/Contact Builder for data extensions and import of raw data
2. Automation Studio for data segmentation
3. Content Builder for EDM builds.
4. Journey Builder for providing contacts the correct path based on their grade.


To build your DEs, kindly check DE_Docu.xlsx for your reference.

To build the automation, create the following SQL queries.
1. Staging1 - select the import DE and do an inner join on the StudentMasterRecord DE to get the boolean fields. this script should also calculate each section of
the grading system mentioned above
2. Staging2 - select the Staging1 DE and calculate the Final Average, Final Grade and Final Remark
3. Final - select the Staging2 DE and only select marketable students.
4. JourneyDE - select all records from the Final DE.

To build the EDMs, create two builds (one for passed and one for failed/dropped)
1. The EDMs should be a marketable send classification to reward students based on their grade
2. Passed EDM build tells students they did a job well done and the promo code they would be getting is based on their final grade.
3. Failed/Dropped EDM build tells students that they failed the subject but will still be rewarded (although a small amount unlike the passers) with a promo code.

To build the journey, utilize a decision split with journey data and should be marketable in email.
